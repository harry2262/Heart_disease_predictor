## Project Description
This machine learning project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in individuals based on various health-related features. Detecting heart disease early is crucial for timely medical intervention and improving patient outcomes.

## Data
### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Heart Disease UCI" dataset obtained from Kaggle. It contains various attributes related to heart health, such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and more. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).

### Data Preprocessing
The dataset underwent preprocessing to prepare it for machine learning. This included handling missing values (if any), encoding categorical features, and splitting the data into training and test sets.

## Model
### Model Selection
For this classification task, a Random Forest Classifier from the Scikit-learn library was chosen as the machine learning model. The default hyperparameters were used for simplicity.

### Training
The model was trained on the training set to learn patterns and relationships in the data. The training duration and any challenges encountered during training were noted.
